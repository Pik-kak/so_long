Summary: This is a 42 school project. I created a basic 2D game of a hobbit collecting mushrooms.

---
The requirements:
1. The playerâ€™s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape
chosing the shortest possible route.
2. The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.
3. At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
4. The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth).
5. The use of the images of the MiniLibX or MLX42 is mandatory.
6. The map has to be constructed with 3 components: walls, collectibles, and free
space.
7. The map must be rectangular and closed/surrounded by walls.
